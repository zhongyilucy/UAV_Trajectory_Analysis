# UAV_Trajectory_Analysis
This is the code implementation of UAV Trajectory Analysis.

Inside this repository is a python program and files that store the flight data.

There are three .csv files: a raw data file, the dataset after process, a .kml file used to draw the path on Google Map, a .csv file used to mark all the points on Google Map, and a file that contains wrong data which will be used to detect.



To run this program:
1) Download the file to the computer.
2) Change the path in the code into the path that the data stores.
3) Run the python file with terminal.
